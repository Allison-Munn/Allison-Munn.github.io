<h1 style="color:white;font-family:script;text-align:center;">First stop, Venus</h1>
<h2 style="color:white;font-family:script">October 1, 2030</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">We first back-tracked to Venus and our tour guide told us that Venus was named after the Roman goddess of love.
   After that we made our way past Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. As we were passing by Jupiter our tour guide stopped
   and told us that Jupiter was the biggest planet in our solar system. By the time we were done with Jupiter we
   all stopped and slept for the night on our space craft. I also had to ask my mom to refill my oxygen tank
   for me since I had trouble taking my helmet off.</p>

   <h1 style="color:white;font-family:script;text-align:center;">Second stop, Jupiter</h1>
   <h2 style="color:white;font-family:script">October 7, 2030</h2>
   <p style="font-family:courier;">After everyone on the ship had a couple days of rest the tour contined, and next in line was Jupiter. The tour
      guide said she had prepared a long presentation full of intresting facts about the giant gas planet. She started
      out by telling everyone that despite Saturn having the least amount of density out of all the planets in our solar
      system; Saturn spins so fast that the planet is also the most flat out of all the planets in our solar system. She
      also told the group that the first astronomers to find Saturn first thought all of Saturn's rings were moons.
      To top it all off, before our lunch brake, she told us only 4 other space craft have visited Saturn. That makes us
      the fifth ever space craft to enter the atmosphere!</p>

      <p style="font-family:courier;">After our lunch brake, which was really good, was over we continued our tour through Saturn. The tour guide then told
      us that despite all of Saturn's rings, Saturn only had 62 moons. On top of that she told us that one of Saturn's moons
      could potentially have life on it, however the scientists are still working on the technology to set up base. As we were
      moving through Saturn's atmosphere the tour guide pointed out that if we went any closer our ship would be covered with
      many bands of clouds. That's because Saturn is a gas planet and it was only natural that clouds would form as an atmosphere.
      It was near the end of the tour guides presentation of Saturn and she ended by telling us that Saturn only orbits the sun
      every 29.4 Earth years. That means since I was born Saturn hasn't orbited the sun yet! The tour guide ended her presentation
      by saying 'Even thought Saturn orbits the sun every 29.4 Earth years, that doesn't mean the days are really short. In fact
      Saturn has an average 10 hour, 32 minute, and 35 second day, so that means it's time for bed everyone!' After I got ready for
      bed with my mother I watched out my window looking at all of Saturn's rings.</p>

      <h1 style="color:white;font-family:script;text-align:center;">Neptune and Pluto, The Last Day!</h1>
      <h2 style="color:white;font-family:script">October 13, 2030</h2>
      <p style="font-family:courier;"> After many days of traveling everyone on the tour space ship was coming to their last stop. I knew a little trivia knowledge
          about Neptune, because my teacher often gave us quizes on the on his favorite planets. I knew that Neptune was named after the
          Roman version of the Greek god Posideon. I also knew that he was the god of the ocean, but that's as far as my trivia knowledge
          goes... I forgot the rest. The tour lady didn't have anything special for Neptune as she did for Saturn. I wonder if her favorite
          planet is Saturn and that's why she did a whole presentation on it.

          <p style="font-family:courier;">After we got through Neptune we stopped at Pluto, it's still
          a debate if Pluto should be considered a planet, to be honest, it's still a planet in my heart. The tour lady told us some intresting
          facts about Pluto as well but I was so hungry from breakfast that I didn't hear anything. So when the tour lady suddenly perked and
          declared that everyone was going to do a trivia quiz. I was pretty confident that I would at least get a few questions correct,
          but when the scores were added up I was one of the lower percentiles. After everyone ate dinner our space ship made it's way back home to
          Earth.</p>
