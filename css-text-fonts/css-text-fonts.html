<p id="dog">
   Dogs generally have brown eyes and wolves almost always have amber or light colored eyes. 
   The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes 
   favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.
   The paws of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait 
   not found in wolves. The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological 
   variation than any other land mammal.
