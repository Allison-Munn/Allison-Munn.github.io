    <h3>All About Washington DC</h3>
    <p>
       Washington DC was founded on July 16, 1790. 
       It was established by the Constitution of the Unided States to serve as the nation's capital.
       However, when the capital was still young, it was completely destroyed by the British in the War of 1812.
       After the war, Washington DC grew exponentially during the Civil War straight after. 
       That's because it remained a hub for freed slaves after the Emancipation Proclamation. 
       Now, it's an amazing complex and layered city with a unique character: a town for locals and a center of power.
