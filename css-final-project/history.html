    <h3>History Of Washington DC</h3>
    <p>Washington DC was founded on July 16, 1790. 
       It was established by the Constitution of the United States to serve as it's nation's capital.
       The first United States President, George Washington, chose the exact site for the nation's capitol.
       He chose it himself to avoid conflict between the northern states and southern states. 
       During the War of 1812, enemies invaded the city and burned most of it to the ground.
       That included the new White House, which was recently built, and the Library of Congress. 
       After the war, the city remained small in physical and population sizes. 
       The city began to grow again right around the the Civil War, because Washington DC was safe house area for the escaped slaves.
       After the war the city began to grow by absorbing smaller towns nearby, like Georgetown and other rural areas.
       In 1964, Washingtonians were first allowed to vote in Presidential elections.
       They were also allowed to finally elect their own mayor in 1973.
       Washington DC today is a vibrant city full of multiple different cultures and a major political center.</p>
